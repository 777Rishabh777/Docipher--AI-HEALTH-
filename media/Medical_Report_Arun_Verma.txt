VITALS:
- Blood Pressure: 145/90 mmHg (elevated)
- Heart Rate: 88 bpm (regular rhythm)
- Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths/min
- Temperature: 98.6°F (37.0°C)

GENERAL: Alert and oriented, in no acute distress.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm. A faint S4 gallop was noted. No murmurs or rubs. Carotid pulses are 2+ and equal bilaterally.
RESPIRATORY: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles.

--------------------------------------------------
7. DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS
--------------------------------------------------
LABORATORY:
- Complete Blood Count (CBC): Within normal limits.
- Lipid Panel:
  - Total Cholesterol: 240 mg/dL (High)
  - LDL Cholesterol: 160 mg/dL (High)
  - HDL Cholesterol: 35 mg/dL (Low)
- HbA1c: 6.8% (Elevated)
- High-Sensitivity Troponin: < 0.01 ng/mL (Negative for acute injury)

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG):
- Normal sinus rhythm. Evidence of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) by voltage criteria. No acute ST-segment changes.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
- Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF): 55% (Normal range).
- Mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy noted.
- Grade 1 diastolic dysfunction (impaired relaxation of the ventricle).

--------------------------------------------------
8. ASSESSMENT / IMPRESSION
--------------------------------------------------
1.  **Stable Angina Pectoris:** The patient's symptoms are highly suggestive of chest pain due to coronary artery disease, brought on by exertion and relieved by rest.
2.  **Hypertensive Heart Disease:** Evidenced by the physical exam (S4 gallop) and ECG findings (LVH). Blood pressure remains elevated despite medication.
3.  **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:** Sub-optimally controlled as indicated by the elevated HbA1c.
4.  **Hyperlipidemia:** Poorly controlled, contributing to his cardiovascular risk.

--------------------------------------------------
9. PLAN & RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------
1.  **Medication Adjustment:**
    - Initiate Aspirin 81 mg daily.
    - Initiate Metoprolol 25 mg daily to help control heart rate and angina symptoms.
    - Increase Atorvastatin to 40 mg daily to target a lower LDL goal.
2.  **Further Testing:**
    - Schedule a Cardiac Stress Test (Treadmill Test) to formally assess for ischemia.
3.  **Lifestyle Counseling:**
    - Provided extensive counseling on the importance of a low-sodium, low-fat diet.
    - Recommended 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, 5 days per week, as tolerated.
4.  **Follow-up:**
    - Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to review the stress test results and check blood pressure response to new medication.
